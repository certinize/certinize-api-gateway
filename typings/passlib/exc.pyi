class PasswordValueError(ValueError):

    Error raised if a password can't be hashed / verified for various reasons.
    This exception derives from the builtin :exc:`!ValueError`.

    May be thrown directly when password violates internal invariants of hasher
    (e.g. some don't support NULL characters).  Hashers may also throw more specific subclasses,
    such as :exc:`!PasswordSizeError`.

    Error raised if a password exceeds the maximum size allowed
    by Passlib (by default, 4096 characters); or if password exceeds
    a hash-specific size limitation.

    This exception derives from :exc:`PasswordValueError` (above).

    Many password hash algorithms take proportionately larger amounts of time and/or
    memory depending on the size of the password provided. This could present
    a potential denial of service (DOS) situation if a maliciously large
    password is provided to an application. Because of this, Passlib enforces
    a maximum size limit, but one which should be *much* larger
    than any legitimate password. :exc:`PasswordSizeError` derives
    from :exc:`!ValueError`.

    .. note::
        Applications wishing to use a different limit should set the
        ``PASSLIB_MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE`` environmental variable before
        Passlib is loaded. The value can be any large positive integer.
